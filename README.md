# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Python (Pfizer Vaccines)

This project demonstrates how to create a sentiment analysis model using Python to analyze Twitter data. The main goal is to identify and classify the sentiments of people regarding Pfizer vaccines. By applying machine learning techniques, we will be able to categorize the sentiments into three categories:

- Positive sentiment
- Negative sentiment
- Neutral sentiment

### Project Overview

In this project, we will:

1. *Collect Twitter Data*: We will use the Kaggle dataset containing tweets related to Pfizer vaccines.
2. *Preprocess the Data*: Clean and prepare the data for analysis by removing unnecessary characters, such as URLs, mentions, hashtags, and special characters.
3. *Feature Extraction*: Convert the text data into numerical form using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
4. *Sentiment Classification*: Apply different machine learning classifiers to classify the sentiment of each tweet as either positive, negative, or neutral.
5. *Evaluate Model Performance*: Evaluate the accuracy and performance of each classifier and select the best-performing model.

### Tools and Libraries Used

- *Python*: The programming language used for this project.
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation and analysis.
- *NumPy*: For numerical operations.
- *Scikit-learn*: For building machine learning models.
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn*: For data visualization.
- *NLTK*: For natural language processing (text preprocessing and tokenization).
- *TfidfVectorizer*: For feature extraction from text data.

### Steps to Run the Project

1. *Clone the Repository*:
   Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   

2. *Install Required Libraries*:
   You need to install the required Python libraries. You can do this using pip or conda.

   bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk
   

3. *Download Dataset*:
   Download the dataset from Kaggle or use any similar dataset that contains tweets related to Pfizer vaccines.

4. *Data Preprocessing*:
   Clean the dataset by removing stop words, punctuation, URLs, and other unnecessary text elements to prepare it for feature extraction.

5. *Feature Extraction*:
   Use TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical vectors that can be used for model training.

6. *Model Training and Evaluation*:
   - Train different classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.).
   - Evaluate the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to choose the best-performing model.

### Classifiers Used

- *Logistic Regression*
- *Naive Bayes*
- *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*
- *Random Forest Classifier*

### Expected Output

The output of this project is a model that can classify the sentiment of a tweet as:
- Positive: Indicates a positive sentiment towards Pfizer vaccines.
- Negative: Indicates a negative sentiment towards Pfizer vaccines.
- Neutral: Indicates a neutral sentiment (neither positive nor negative).

### Conclusion

By the end of this project, you will have built a machine learning model capable of performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data, specifically focusing on sentiments related to Pfizer vaccines. Additionally, you will have gained experience in text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.
